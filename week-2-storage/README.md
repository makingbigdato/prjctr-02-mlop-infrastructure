# Storage and processing of ML data

## Deployment and usage `minio` on `kind`

### Local cluster with `kind`

1. Install `kind`

2. Create local cluster and play around with it

```bash
kind create cluster --name local-cluster
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-local-cluster
kubectl get {nodes|pods|deploy|services}
kind get nodes --name=local-cluster
>>> local-cluster-control-plane
kind get clusters
>>> local-cluster
kind get kubeconfig --name=local-cluster
kind delete cluster --name=local-cluster
```

3. [OPTIONAL] Load your docker image into local cluster (test with well-known web service)

```bash
kind load docker-image yevhenk10s/prjctr02-infrastructure:latest --name=local-cluster

kubectl apply -f ../week-1/.cluster/pod-conf.yaml
kubectl port-forward web-dl 8000:5000
curl localhost:8000
curl -X POST localhost:8000 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"texts": ["hello, world", "this is a sentance"]}'
kubectl delete -f ../week-1/.cluster/pod-conf.yaml
```

### Install and initialize `minio`

Main HOWTHO is on the official [README](https://github.com/minio/operator/blob/master/README.md).

1. Install (locally)

```bash
wget -qO- https://github.com/minio/operator/releases/latest/download/kubectl-minio_linux_amd64.zip | bsdtar -xvf- -C ~/.local/bin
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/kubectl-minio
```

2. Verify installation

```bash
kubectl minio version
>>> v4.5.0
```
3. Creates a new namespace for the MinIO Tenant.

```bash
kubectl create namespace minio-tenant-1
```

4. Initialize the **Operator**

```bash
kubectl minio init
```

Check initialization status:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n minio-operator
kubectl get deploy -n minio-operator
kubectl get services -n minio-operator
kubectl get all --namespace minio-operator
```

Wait for all pods (`console` and `minio-operator`) to start.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n minio-operator
```

```
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
console-78d84698bb-9j9kv          1/1     Running   0          99s
minio-operator-7cdd5b86f8-gnh6q   0/1     Pending   0          99s
minio-operator-7cdd5b86f8-r8w6n   1/1     Running   0          99s
```

4. Access to the Operator Console:

Run the following command to create a local proxy to the MinIO Operator Console:

```bash
kubectl minio proxy -n minio-operator
```

Configure minio and save [setting](https://docs.min.io/minio/k8s/tenant-management/deploy-minio-tenant.html), crate a **Tenant**. You'll get credential on web UI while saving config.

Tenant config:
* Setup
  - name: **mytenant**
  - namespace: **minio-tenant-1**  <-- this was given when a new kubernetes namespace was created `kubectl create namespace minio-tenant-1`
  - number of servers: **1**
  - drives per server: **1**
  - total size: **1Gi**
* Security
  - TLS: **OFF** (necessary to be able to connect locally)
  - AutoCert: **OFF** (necessary to be able to connect locally)

Security if **off** because I didn't manage to properly configure certificates: there are no well detailed documentation of how to do it properly especially on `kind` local cluster.

Wait for the cluster to pull all necessary dependencies. The button `Console` will become active.

Now, the server is running with the following command in a background:

```bash
ps -aux | grep "minio server"
>>> minio server --certs-dir /tmp/certs --console-address :9090
```

Check the status of `minio-tenant-1` namespace:

```bash
kubectl get all --namespace minio-tenant-1
```

Go to created tenant, press `Console` button. Then `Identity` --> `Users` and create new user that will have access to the tenant, for example:
- User Name: **miniouser**
- Password: **miniopassword**
- Policies:
  - consoleAdmin
  - diagnostics
  - readwrite

### Connect to `minio` from Python or console.

Use an example provided in the [documentation](https://docs.min.io/docs/python-client-quickstart-guide.html).

1. Check ports `minio` and `console` are running on:

```bash
kubectl get service --namespace minio-tenant-1
```

You'll get result similar to the following:

```
NAME                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
minio                     LoadBalancer   10.96.30.21     <pending>     80:30159/TCP     10m
mytenant-console          LoadBalancer   10.96.96.214    <pending>     9090:30846/TCP   10m
mytenant-hl               ClusterIP      None            <none>        9000/TCP         10m
mytenant-log-hl-svc       ClusterIP      None            <none>        5432/TCP         9m11s
mytenant-log-search-api   ClusterIP      10.96.221.207   <none>        8080/TCP         9m11s
```

According to the [documentation](https://docs.min.io/minio/k8s/tenant-management/deploy-minio-tenant.html) (right on the bottom of the page):
- The `minio` service corresponds to the MinIO Tenant service. Applications should use this service for performing operations against the MinIO Tenant.
- The `*-console` service corresponds to the [MinIO Console](https://github.com/minio/console). Administrators should use this service for accessing the MinIO Console and performing administrative operations on the MinIO Tenant.

So, let's interrupt Minio Operator web UI (currently running on localhost:9090 according to `kubectl minio proxy -n minio-operator` command we've executed earlier) by terminating port-forwarding. We use it only for initilal cluster set up and tenant creation.

2. Start port forwarding for console to be able to programmatically connect to the minio:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/minio 8080:80 -n minio-tenant-1
```

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/mytenant-console 9090:9090 -n minio-tenant-1
```

3. Test connection

- `mc` (follow the instructions for [installation](https://docs.min.io/minio/baremetal/reference/minio-mc.html))
  - configure `~/.mc/config.json` file and add the following content:
    
```json
{
	"version": "10",
	"aliases": {
		"local": {
			"url": "http://localhost:8080",
			"accessKey": "miniouser",
			"secretKey": "miniopassword",
			"api": "S3v4",
			"path": "auto"
		}
	}
}
```
    `accessKey` and `secretKey` are just login and password of the user created for the tenant earlier
  - run `miniocli admin info local` to test connection, the output will may look like the following:
    ```
    ‚óè   localhost:8080
        Uptime: 37 minutes 
        Version: 2022-09-07T22:25:02Z
        Network: 1/1 OK 
        Drives: 1/1 OK 
        Pool: 1

    Pools:
        1st, Erasure sets: 1, Disks per erasure set: 1

    1 drive online, 0 drives offline
    ```
  
  - run `file_uploader.py` with a given credentials, the output will may look like the following:
    ```
    Bucket 'dataset' already exists
    './file_uploader.py' is successfully uploaded as object 'file_uploader.py' to bucket 'dataset'.
    ```

## Parallelization benchmarking

### Data Set

Data Set is available on the Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/commonlitreadabilityprize/overview).

### Data Set Integration

Download `train.csv` files from Kaggle competition site and put the file in the `./dataset` folder.

### Benchmarking Summary

```
Number of cpus                      : 8
Dataset len                         : 2834

[Single Process] Preprocessing      : 00:00:05
[Single Process] Inference          : 00:01:56
[Single Process] Total              : 00:02:02

[Multiple Processes] Preprocessing  : 00:00:01
[Multiple Processes] Inference      : 00:01:52
[Multiple Processes] Total          : 00:01:53
```

### Conclusion

For the current setup and amount of data the bottleneck of the pipeline is the inference stage, not the data preprocessing stage.

## DVC Setup with MinIO support

1. Install DVC with PIP:

```bash
pip install dvc dvc-s3
```

2. Initilalize DVC

```bash
dvc init
```

3. Add dataset to DVC

```bash
dvc add week-2-storage/dataset
```

4. Add to git updated files

```bash
git add week-2-storage/dataset.dvc week-2-storage/.gitignore
git commit -m "Add raw data"
```

5. Configure DVC to work with MinOI

**It is NOT SECURE** to store secrets in the repo. It is done for educational purposes only!

```bash
dvc remote add -d minio s3://dataset -f
dvc remote modify minio secret_access_key miniopassword
dvc remote modify minio access_key_id miniouser
dvc remote modify minio endpointurl http://localhost:8080
git add .dvc/config
git commit -m "Configure remote storage"
```

6. Push dataset to the minio service

```bash
dvc push
```

7. Push all changes to git

```bash
git push
```

8. [OPTIONAL] Check if dvc pushed dataset to the minio server

```bash
mc ls local
mc ls local/dataset
```

## Label Studio

Installation

```bash
pip install label-studio
label-studio start
```

Whait for a while for initial set up complete. Then navigate to `localhost:8080`

Usage

1. Create account
```
login: user-cli@example.com
password: password
```
2. Create project
3. Upload folder with images
4. Select a task (for example, image classification)
5. Start labeling
6. After labeling is done you can export results of labeling in different formats (csv, json)

Observations

1. Labeling image for classification task (binary classification) took 14 minutes for 50 images
2. Tha lack of keyboard shortcuts makes it difficult to swiftly label images
3. Some UI bugs meke it difficult tu label images
4. Sloooow response for submitting class for image. Usually it takes 10-15 seconds to submit/update image class in constrast to 1-2 seconds for labeling itself.

Labeling process could take just 2-4 minutes if there were no UI bugs, convenient keyboard shortcuts, and high speed for updating/submitting image class.
